<h3>Windows Console is the infrastructure for console applications in Microsoft Windows. An instance of a Windows Console has a screen buffer and an input buffer. It allows console apps to run inside a window or in hardware text mode. The user can switch between the two using the Alt+â†µ Enter key combination.</h3>
<h3>The console is an operating system window where users interact with the operating system or with a text-based console application by entering text input through the computer keyboard, and by reading text output from the computer terminal.Chrome. Step 1: To open the console in Chrome, use this keyboard shortcut: "Cmd + Option + J" (on a Mac) or "Ctrl +Shift +J" (on Windows).
